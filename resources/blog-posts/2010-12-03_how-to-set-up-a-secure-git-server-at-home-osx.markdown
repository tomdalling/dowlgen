In this article I'm going to show you, step by step, how to set up an OSX
machine to provide secure access to git repositories over the internet via ssh.
This was tested on OSX 10.6.

[github][] provides git repository hosting with a lovely interface. If github
isn't feasible, then this article will help you set up something similar,
unfortunately without the nice interface.

I assume that you already have git installed. If not, install the latest
version from [the git website][].

We will be walking through the following steps:

 -  Give the server a static IP address on the local network
 -  Set up port forwarding on the router
 -  Getting dynamic DNS
 -  Add a user named "git" to the server
 -  Setting up ssh securely on the client computers
 -  Setting up ssh securely on the server
 -  Making a bare git repository
 -  Using your new git server

Step 1. Give the server a static IP address on the local network
----------------------------------------------------------------

The server needs a static IP address on the local network for the next step
(port forwarding) to work. This can be set in the following location:

*System Preferences &raquo; Network &raquo; Advanced &raquo; TCP/IP*

If the *Configure IPv4* option is set to *Manual* or *Using DHCP with manual
address*, then you already have a static IP address.

If the *Configure IPv4* option is set to *Using DHCP*, then change it to *Using
DHCP with manual address*. Set the *IPv4 Address* option to an address that
won't conflict with the DHCP addresses from the router. I'm going to use
192.168.1.150 as an example of the server's static IP address.

Remember the *IPv4 Address* setting and the *Router* setting, as these will be
needed in the next step.


Step 2. Setting Up Port Forwarding On The Router
------------------------------------------------

With the default settings, your home router most likely acts as a firewall to
the internet outside. The router usually ignores inbound connection requests
from the internet. To allow people to access the git repo via the internet, we
need to add a port forwarding rule.

Open up your web browser and type the IP address of your router into the
address bar. Once inside the router configuration page, you'll have to hunt
around for the port fowarding options because each router is different.

ssh usually works on port 22, but for extra security, we're going to expose a
different port to the internet. Think of a port number between 1024 and 65535
that you will remember; I'm going to use port 12345 as an example.

Configure the router so that the external port 12345 is forwarded to the
internal port 22 of the servers static IP address (set in Step 1), like so:

<img src="/images/posts/git-server-osx/router_config.png" />

Save the settings on the router.


Step 3. Getting dynamic DNS
---------------------------

Unless you've paid your ISP for a static IP address, your router's IP address
on the internet will change from time to time. To avoid having to work out the
IP address every few days, you can set up dynamic DNS to automatically give the
correct IP address.

I'll leave out the details for brevity, but you can get this service for free
at places like [DynDNS.com][]. You basically sign up for a free domain name
like *example.dyndns.org*, then you install a program on the server that
constantly updates the domain with the current IP address.

Instead of doing this...

```sh
git clone ssh://git@124.186.120.123:12345/myrepo.git
```

you can do this...

```sh
git clone ssh://git@example.dyndns.org:12345/myrepo.git
```

Step 4. Add a user named "git" to the server
--------------------------------------------

I'm going to add a single user to the server. All clients will connect via this
single user when pushing and pulling from the repo. You could set up a user for
each client if you wanted, but it's by no means necessary.

Open up *System Preferences &raquo; Accounts* and add a standard user like so:

<img src="/images/posts/git-server-osx/git_user.png" />

Log into the new *git* user account. Open *Terminal.app* and type the
following:

```sh
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/git/bin/"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Log out of the *git* user, and log back into your administrator account.

Step 5. Setting up ssh securely on the client computers
-------------------------------------------------------

Even with a non-standard ssh port, your computer is open to automated password
guessing attacks from the internet. If your user name is something common like
"bob", and your password is something easy to guess like "abc123", then you may
be in danger.

To harden up the security, we are going to disable authentication with
passwords. Instead, authentication will be done with ssh public keys. You can
think of ssh public keys as very long, randomly generated passwords that you
don't have to type in. 

This step must be completed on every client computer that wishes to connect to
the server. **Do not do this step on the server.**

Open up *Terminal.app* and type the following:

```sh
cd
mkdir -p .ssh
cd .ssh
ssh-keygen -f my_git_key -t rsa -q
ssh-add -K my_git_key
cp my_git_key.pub ~/Desktop
```

You should see something like this:

<img src="/images/posts/git-server-osx/ssh_key_terminal.png" />

When it asks you to type in a passphrase I advise you to do so, even though
it's optional. If someone steals your computer, the passphrase on the key
prevents them from connecting to the server. It is just an added layer of
security.

You should now have a file called *my_git_key.pub* on your desktop. This is one
half of your key, stored as a text file. **Keep this file, because it is
needed in the next step.**

Feel free to open *my_git_key.pub* in any text editor to have a look at it.
Like I said, it looks like a very long random password.


Step 6. Setting up ssh securely on the server
---------------------------------------------

Now we're going to set up the server to accept secure connections.

First, open up *System Preferences &raquo; Sharing* and turn on *Remote Login*
(this is ssh). Set *Allow access for* to *Only these users*, and add the *git*
user to the list. It should look like this:

<img src="/images/posts/git-server-osx/ssh_preferences.png" />

Now open *Terminal.app* and type in `sudo open /etc/sshd_config`. When it asks
you for a password, type in your login password for the account you are
curently in. This step requires your account to be an administrator account. 

In the newly opened text editor, change the following lines as indicated below.

| Find this line                         | Change it to this                    |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `#PermitRootLogin yes`                 | `PermitRootLogin no`                 |
| `#PasswordAuthentication no`           | `PasswordAuthentication no`          |
| `#ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes` | `ChallengeResponseAuthentication no` |
| `#UsePAM yes`                          | `UsePAM no`                          |

Save the file and quit it.

Now, log out of your current account and log into the *git* user that we
created in Step 4. Open up *Terminal.app* again, and type in the following:

```sh
cd
mkdir -p .ssh
touch .ssh/authorized_keys
open -a "TextEdit" .ssh/authorized_keys
```

This should open a file called *authorized_keys*, and that file should be
completely empty at this point.

Now, remember the *my_git_key.pub* files from Step 5? There should be one of
these files on the desktop of every client computer. You will need these files
now on the server computer.

Each *my_git_key.pub* file contains a single line of text. If your editor is
set to wrap text then it may look like more than one line, but it isn't. This
is important, because putting a new line anywhere will break the file.

Get each *my_git_key.pub* file, copy the single line from it, and paste it into
the blank text file (*authorized_keys*) on a new line. Each line in
*authorized_keys* should hold the entire contents of each *my_git_key.pub*
file. If there are four clients, then there should be four lines. You get the
idea.

*TextEdit.app* doesn't have the option to turn off text wrapping, so I advise
you use  a better text editor such as [TextWrangler][], which is free. To open
the file in TextWrangler instead of TextEdit, just replace "TextEdit" with
"TextWrangler" in the *Terminal.app* commands above.

Save the *authorized_keys* file, and restart the server computer.

7. Making a bare git repository
-------------------------------

Now that everything should be set up, all that remains is to make the git
repository.

You can't push a branch to a server if that branch is currently checked out on
the server. That would cause problems for whoever is working on the server.
Seeing as nobody is actually working on the server this isn't a problem,
because nothing needs to be checkout out. This is the definition of a "bare"
git repo: a repository that can never have files checked out. Everyone pulls
and pushes from the server like normal, but nobody can actually work on the
server (unless they make a non-bare clone).

If you are creating a new repository called "my_bare_repo.git", you can make it
bare like so:

```sh
git init --bare my_bare_repo.git
```

If you have an existing repo, you can make a bare clone of it like so:

```sh
git clone --bare /wherever/the/existing/repo/is.git
```


8. Using your new git server
----------------------------

Let's say you have the following setup:

| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Dynamic domain     | mygit.dyndns.org       |
| Forwarded port     | 12345                  |
| Bare git repo path | /Users/git/my_repo.git |

On the client machine, you would clone the repo like so:

```sh
git clone ssh://git@mygit.dyndns.org:12345/Users/git/my_repo.git
```

If you have an existing local repo, you can add a remote named "home" like so:

```sh
git remote add home ssh://git@mygit.dyndns.org:12345/Users/git/my_repo.git
```

This may ask you for a password when it tries to authenticate with your ssh
key. This is the password you typed in in Step 5. It may be different for each
client computer.

Once you've got your cloned repo, you work on it like normal. You pull down
updates from the server with `git fetch` or `git pull`, and you push branches
with `git push origin branch_name_here`.
